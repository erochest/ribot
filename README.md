# Overview

This is a toy IRC bot written using Haskell.

# Features

* <span style='color:silver';>Chat logging;</span>
* <span style='color:silver';>Log searches.</span>

# Architecture

This is a chance for me to play with structuring a program using [monads][1].

Here are the monads I plan to stack up:

* `IO` provides network interaction and IRC parsing and commands.
* `Writer` provides logging.
* `Either` provides error handling.
